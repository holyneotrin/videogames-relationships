        <p>Much like many things, there is a generational gap present in gamers. Older gamers more commonly play more casual games usually on their phone and often not against other people.
          Whereas younger gamers tend to play more multiplayer games and are more focused on the action genre and represent the vast majority of those who play shooters.
          The biggest difference between millenials and gen Z is present in the fact that gen Z are more likely to have grown up with video games as they started having a massive market
          presence around the time gen Zers would be old enough to start playing them.
        </p>
        <p>Alright some hardcore gamers may tell you otherwise, people who play mobile games are in fact included in those who play games. Mobile games are not often played with others
          but when they are we see this generational gap there as well. An increasingly popular genre of game is the party game, lots of which are made by Jackbox games.
          This genre of game has one central computer that runs things and then everyone else plays on their phones. They are often based on board games of a similar vein.
          These are popular with mostly millenials but some gen Z as well.
