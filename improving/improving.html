        <h2><b> Games that ruin relationships :<b></h2>
              <h3> Mario Kart/ Mario Party Games </h3>
                <p>They seem like bright, colorful, and peaceful games, but when you play it feels the exact opposite(Items, Blue Shells, etc.)
                So much tension in games like these as they can get competitive real quick.
              </p>
              <h3> Among us </h3>
                <p> A very social game that involves lots of trust and lying which is just a recipe for destroying relationships.
                </p>
              <h3> Uno </h3>
                <p> A game where everything can change and all of the fun is ruined by a simple “+4 card” which can easily lead to heated moments with those around you.
                </p>
              <h3> Monopoly </h3>
                <p> A highly long but intense game that can easily involve lots of arguing.
                    Games like this where the rules aren’t always specific always leads to an argument over the “rulebook”.

        <h2><b> Games that improve relationships :<b></h2>
              <h3> Minecraft </h3>
                <p> A fun and calming game where many friends can gather along and play in their own world and create whatever their minds desire.
                </p>
              <h3> Grand Theft Auto </h3>
                <p> An action- adventure game where friends can set their mind to whatever they want to and go off and make many laughs and memories together.
                </p>

      <div class="col">
        <h2> Differences between these games? </h2>
          <p> One of the more obvious and biggest difference between the games that improve relationships and the games that ruin friendships is the fact that the games that
              improve relationships usually require teamwork and communicating with others whereas the games that ruin friendships are usually the games where its a free for all and
              every man is for themselves trying to win the game. Another difference between these games is that the games that ruin friendships usually have an ending to it until
              someone wins, whereas in the games that improve relationships don't exactly have an ending to it where you have to start over and start a new game.
