          <h1>Gamers vs Non-Gamers</h1>
            <p>Learning how to play a video game is like learning a new language. There are things that are similar to other languages, but most of the time, a person beginning to learn the language won't understand what is being said until they start practicing and listening. Some basics of game language would be that most games have a jump button, a run button, and an interact button. Many players are familiar with opening a new game and trying to figure out their actions to utilize the most out of the game. However, if a person is playing their first game, they might not know about a run button unless they are prompted with a tutorial. Although we might laugh at the idea of someone not knowing about a run button, most gamers started off as that person. We didn't know that knowledge unless we watched or heard of those mechanics. There is a great YouTube channel, Razbuten, that has created a series of videos where he has his wife, a person who has never grew up with video games, play a whole bunch of games without telling her anything about them. These informal experiments allow Razbuten to understand what the thought process is of a non-gamer and figure out if games could be improved to be more friendly for non-gamers.

            <p>On the opposite end, board games are different beast to tackle. People who enjoy board games were introduced to them at a young age and have a connection to them as an adult.

As adults its hard to take away what has been ingrained into our minds, especially bad game night experiences. Nick Bentley of Underdog Games Studio presents a couple ways how to possibly cure your disklike towards board games.
