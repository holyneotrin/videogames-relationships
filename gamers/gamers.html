  <p>Learning how to play a video game is like learning a new language. There are things that are similar to other languages, but most of the time, a person beginning to learn the language won't understand what is being said until they start practicing and listening. Some basics of game language would be that most games have a jump button, a run button, and an interact button. Many players are familiar with opening a new game and trying to figure out their actions to utilize the most out of the game. However, if a person is playing their first game, they might not know about a run button unless they are prompted with a tutorial. Although we might laugh at the idea of someone not knowing about a run button, most gamers started off as that person. We didn't know that knowledge unless we watched or heard of those mechanics. There is a great YouTube channel, Razbuten, that has created a series of videos where he has his wife, a person who has never grew up with video games, play a whole bunch of games without telling her anything about them. These informal experiments allow Razbuten to understand what the thought process is of a non-gamer and figure out if games could be improved to be more friendly for non-gamers.</p>
