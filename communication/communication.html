        <h1>Communication in Games</h1>
        <p>
          The way we communicate when we play games is often different than how we do in other situations. The often competitive nature of games can make us act in ways that we normally would not.
          This includes changesin our speech. You see a similar thing in sports however games can depict situations that would not happen in sports. There is an interesting playfulness to how people
          interact about things that would usually not be playful. For instance when outside of Monopoly are you going to hear anyone say "oh screw you I was going to buy that property."
          Or with more violent games such as shooters people can say "C'mon stop killing me" or similar things. On the other side of things, people who are really competitive can
          get angry at other players especially when they feel they are unable to compete with them either because of a lack of skill or more commonly some unfair advantage that they have.
        </p>
        <p>
          People who get really good at certain games develop a language of their own to quickly communicate things. This can be seen in the shooter Counter Strike: Global Offensive.
          Players use complicated slang to quickly communicate their position, the amount of health they have left, and other critical information.
